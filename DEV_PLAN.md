## üß± PHASE 1: Project Setup

| Task | Status | Prompt |
|------|--------|--------|
| Scaffold Flutter project | ‚¨ú | `Create a Flutter project named AllTune with lib/, assets/, and pubspec.yaml ready for a tuner app.` |
| Set up folder structure | ‚úÖ | `Structure the app into: lib/screens, lib/widgets, lib/models, lib/utils, assets/images, and assets/audio.` |
| Add Flutter + Dart plugins | ‚úÖ | Use Android Studio: Preferences > Plugins |
| Initial README.md | ‚úÖ | `Write a README for a Flutter app called AllTune, a universal music tuner with offline pitch detection and multiple tunings.` |
| pubspec.yaml dependencies | ‚úÖ | `Add dependencies for: mic input (flutter_audio_capture or flutter_fft), animations, shared_preferences, ad support.` |

---

## üé∏ PHASE 2: Core Tuner Engine

| Task | Status | Prompt |
|------|--------|--------|
| Microphone access | ‚¨ú | `Request and handle mic permission for Flutter on Android and iOS.` |
| Pitch detection logic | ‚¨ú | `Implement pitch detection using flutter_fft or a native plugin. Output frequency and closest musical note.` |
| Tuning dial widget | ‚¨ú | `Create a Flutter widget for an analog-style tuning dial that displays pitch deviation from target.` |
| Note matching algorithm | ‚¨ú | `Write a Dart function that matches detected frequency to the closest note from a tuning preset.` |

---

## üéº PHASE 3: Instrument & Tuning Presets

| Task | Status | Prompt |
|------|--------|--------|
| Define instrument model | ‚¨ú | `Create a Dart model for instruments, tunings, and alternate tuning presets (e.g., standard, drop D, open G).` |
| Swipeable instrument UI | ‚¨ú | `Build a swipeable PageView in Flutter to switch between instruments with tuning data displayed.` |
| Tuning selection dropdown | ‚¨ú | `Add a dropdown or toggle button to select alternate tunings per instrument.` |

---

## üé® PHASE 4: UI & Experience

| Task | Status | Prompt |
|------|--------|--------|
| Light/dark theme support | ‚¨ú | `Create light and dark themes for a Flutter app with modern, musical styling.` |
| Large icons & fonts | ‚¨ú | `Ensure UI uses high-contrast fonts and large icons for accessibility while staying visually sleek.` |
| Animated tuning feedback | ‚¨ú | `Animate the tuning dial to glow or pulse when the pitch is in tune.` |
| Portrait & landscape layout | ‚¨ú | `Make the UI responsive and functional in both portrait and landscape modes on phones/tablets.` |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 5: Settings & Local Storage

| Task | Status | Prompt |
|------|--------|--------|
| Save selected instrument | ‚¨ú | `Use shared_preferences to store last-used instrument and tuning on the device.` |
| Basic settings screen | ‚¨ú | `Build a settings screen to toggle display options (e.g. frequency, note name, theme).` |

---

## üí∞ PHASE 6: Monetization

| Task | Status | Prompt |
|------|--------|--------|
| Ad integration | ‚¨ú | `Add banner or interstitial ads using Google Mobile Ads SDK in Flutter.` |

---

## üß™ PHASE 7: Testing & Optimization

| Task | Status | Prompt |
|------|--------|--------|
| Unit tests for pitch detection | ‚¨ú | `Write unit tests to confirm correct note matching for given frequencies.` |
| Device compatibility test | ‚¨ú | `Test mic access, pitch detection, and UI scaling across Android and iOS devices.` |
| Performance tuning | ‚¨ú | `Profile pitch detection and UI rendering. Optimize for low-latency tuning updates.` |

---

## üöÄ PHASE 8: Build & Publish

| Task | Status | Prompt |
|------|--------|--------|
| App icon & splash screen | ‚¨ú | `Use flutter_launcher_icons and flutter_native_splash to create branding.` |
| Privacy policy file | ‚¨ú | `Write a privacy policy for an offline app that uses mic input but collects no personal data.` |
| Build for iOS/Android | ‚¨ú | `Prepare Android and iOS builds using Flutter build tools and update manifests for mic permissions.` |
| Submit to stores | ‚¨ú | `Guide me through Play Store and App Store submission for a Flutter app.` |
